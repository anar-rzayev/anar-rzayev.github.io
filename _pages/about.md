I'm Anar Rzayev, a researcher working at the intersection of geometric deep learning and therapeutic discovery. My journey from mathematical olympiads to protein design has been guided by a fascinating realization: while proteins are nature's most complex molecular machines, their function emerges from fundamental geometric principles that can be understood through the lens of mathematics and AI.

At KAIST and EPFL, I've focused on developing what I call "context-aware geometric AI" â€“ systems that can understand and design therapeutic proteins by learning their underlying geometric patterns. My work spans from engineering fluorescent proteins to designing antibodies for next-generation vaccines, combining insights from protein design, medical imaging, and computational geometry. When I'm not working on protein structures, you can find me teaching discrete mathematics at KAIST or mentoring aspiring mathematical olympiad participants.

If you're curious to learn more about my work and experience, you can check out my [CV](https://anar-rzayev.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
