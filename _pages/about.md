Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anar Rzayev, a researcher working at the intersection of **geometric deep learning** and **therapeutic discovery**. My journey from **mathematical olympiads** to **protein design** revealed how proteins, nature's most complex molecular machines, function through geometric principles that can be understood via **mathematics** and **AI**.

At **KAIST** and **EPFL**, I develop "**context-aware geometric AI**" for protein design and analysis. I work with [Prof. Ho Min Kim](https://pure.kaist.ac.kr/en/persons/ho-min-kim) at KAIST, where my research spans from engineering **fluorescent proteins** to designing **antibodies**, combining insights from structural biology, medical imaging, and computational geometry.

My research interests include:

- **Geometric Deep Learning**: SE(3)-equivariant architectures for molecular design
- **Protein Engineering**: Structure-guided design with evolutionary priors
- **Medical AI**: Multi-scale molecular-to-clinical translation
- **Diffusion Models**: Markov processes for molecularÂ generation

If you're curious to learn more about my work and experience, you can check out my [CV](https://anar-rzayev.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf). Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:rzayev.anar1@kaist.ac.kr) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/anar~rzayev).
