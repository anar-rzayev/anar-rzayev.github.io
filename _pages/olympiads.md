My journey in mathematical olympiads spans both sides of the competition floor. Beginning as a participant representing Azerbaijan, I've transitioned into teaching, coaching, and serving as a leader at prestigious international competitions, allowing me to give back to the community that shaped my mathematical foundation.

## Coaching and Leadership Experience

Since 2020, I've been actively contributing to the olympiad community through various roles. As a deputy leader at major international competitions like IMO and EGMO 2020, I've had the privilege of supporting young mathematicians in their competitive journeys. My responsibilities have included teaching advanced problem-solving techniques in Number Theory and Algebra, translating competition problems with precision, and participating in the critical coordination processes.

Key Leadership Roles:

- **Deputy Leader** at International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 2020
- **Deputy Leader** at [European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO)](https://www.egmo.org/people/person2219/) 2020
- **Coach** for competitive mathematics training sessions focusing on Number Theory and Algebra
- **Technical Support** in official problem translation and coordination at international competitions

## Competition Achievements

My competitive career includes multiple medals at various international and national competitions:

- **Bronze Medal** at [International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=27733) 2017 & 2019
- **Gold Medal** at Azerbaijan National Science Olympiad (Mathematics) 2017 & 2019
- **Silver Medal** at Balkan Mathematical Olympiad (BMO) 2019
- **Bronze Medal** at Balkan Mathematical Olympiad (BMO) 2018

Through these experiences, both as a competitor and leader, I've developed a deep appreciation for the role mathematical olympiads play in fostering problem-solving skills and mathematical thinking among young students. I continue to be passionate about contributing to this community and helping develop the next generation of mathematical talent.
